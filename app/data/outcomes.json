(For example, a food or drink outlet which only provides takeaways, or someone collecting a pre-reserved book from the library. If a business offers a mixture of a sit-in and takeaway service, contact information only needs to be collected for customers who are staying in.)\n\nThis guidance does not apply to drop-off deliveries made by suppliers or contractors.\n\nYou should assist the test and trace service by keeping a temporary record of your staff shift patterns for 21 days and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that data if needed. This could help contain clusters or outbreaks.\n\n[Check the detailed guidance](/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace#information-to-collect) for what data you need to collect and how it should be managed."
